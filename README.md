# ClinicMS-Project

> This project is java based with an added connection of MS SQL with a local server
> This code was written as part of a semester group project for the course of object oriented programming (OOP)
> Project has some additional functionalities apart from just implementing OOP
> Project may also contain some redundant and unnecessary code because this was just made by a bunch of students :)
